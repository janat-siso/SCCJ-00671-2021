My front end folder contains my home page, sign up page, log in page and BMI calculator.
The database.sql file contains the code for the overweight and underweight meal plans.
fetch.php fetches data from the overweight meal plan table and db.php fetches data from the underweight meal plan table.
The file GREEN APPLE contains the description of the system and the elements used to create the diagrams and models of the system.
The user signs up and the data is stored in the database. The user is then able to input his/her weight and height and the BMI is calculated. The BMI classifications will let the user know whether he/she is underweight, normal or overweight. The user can then access a meal plan according to his/her classification.
